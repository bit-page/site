    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>Umeed</strong>, we believe that talent knows no boundaries. Our mission is to uncover and support talented individuals from underrepresented and rural backgrounds who often lack access to digital platforms and opportunities.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Umeed?</h2>
    <p>
      "Umeed" means "Hope" — and that’s exactly what we aim to provide. We connect folk artists, craftsmen, singers, dancers, and other skilled individuals with sponsors, mentors, and buyers who believe in their potential.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We envision a world where every individual, regardless of their location or background, has an equal chance to be discovered, supported, and celebrated. With technology, compassion, and community, Umeed strives to bring dreams to light.
    </p>

    <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
    <p>
      We are a group of passionate full-stack learners from the IMB program, working together to create meaningful solutions. This project is a reflection of our dedication to blending tech with purpose.
